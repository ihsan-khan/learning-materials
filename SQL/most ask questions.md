<ul>


Here are several ways to find the second highest salary from an employees table:

## Method 1: Using LIMIT and OFFSET (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
```sql
SELECT salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

## Method 2: Using Subquery (Works in most databases)

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```
</ul>
</details>

## 2 Fetch all employees whose names contain the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù exactly twice.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE LENGTH(name) - LENGTH(REPLACE(name, 'a', '')) = 2;
```

## 3 How do you retrieve only duplicate records FROM a table?

```sql
SELECT email, COUNT(*) FROM employee GROUP BY email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employee e1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employee e2
    WHERE e1.email = e2.email
      AND e1.id <> e2.id
);
```

## 4 Write a query to calculate the running total of sales by date.

```sql
SELECT 
  s1.sales_date,
  s1.sales_amount,
  (
    SELECT SUM(sales_amount) FROM 
    sales as s2 WHERE s2.sales_date <= s1.sales_date 
  ) AS running_total
sales as s1
ORDER BY s1.sales_date
```
